Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Gaming Room is a game development copmany seeking to expand their game "Draw it or Lose it" from Android only to more devices. Their game is similar to the TV game show Win, Lose or Draw. They wanted to allow the same game play among mulitple teams of multiple people with the ability to run on a secure server with user authentication and allow images to be downloaded and revealed slowly, giving each time time to guess before the image was complete.
    
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In particular, the model description in this document is pretty well rounded and complete.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having constraints writted down and accounted for was a huge help. It helped with knowing which design patterns were useful as well as having a roadmap with which to create the functions.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would spend more time on studying the security issues with a cloud platform and how they relate to this client-server design pattern and then be more clear about how the app would handle any potential security risks while in operation. Though the API handled it well, I still think the security portion could be more clear and more well understood.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Ultimately, if the user can't use the interface or doesn't like it, the game will not be successful, so to ensure the interpretation of the user's needs was accurate, clarifying questions were asked. Where questions couldn't be asked, standard best practices were used.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Questions. I like to ask questions. Having a very clear direction of the customer's needs is so crucial to being able to design a game. If one existed already, or course that would be used for initial inspiration.

For future software like this, I would definitely refer to this design to start and then research the security options. I would then ask a lot of in person questions to make sure I fully understand what is being asked for. Customization deserves to be exactly what a customer wants. In the end, of course, budget will always be a constraint, but why not start with a design that is exactly what the customer wants, then rollback things that can be rolled back wihout compromising the overall quality of the application.
